How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the use case. you should have a working demo of it.
Ans) We can set multiple remote by using below command.
git remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>

For example:

git remote add origin https://github.com/SahilBheke25/GitAssignment.git

git remote add gitlab https://gitlab.com/trainee4052801/GitAssignment.git

We can also check the remote available by using following command.
git remote -v


Use case:
1) Primary remote hosted on GitHub(origin) can be used as open-source contributions.
   Secondary remote hosted on GitLab(GitLab) can be used for internal backups and testing.
2) Backup: If one remote is unavailable, we have a complete mirror of the repository on different platform.
3) Collaboration: Some collaborators might prefer different platforms.
