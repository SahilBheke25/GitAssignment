What happens when a file is deleted in the main branch and updated in a feature branch, and how is this handled during a merge?
Ans) Conflict occurs and the situation is flagged as a "modify/delete" conflict.
Conflict can be resolved by:
1) Giving precedence to the deletion in the main branch.
2) Preserving updated file in the feature branch.

In my case git preserved the updated file in the feature branch.
As git assumed that the modification done in the feature branch is more recent.

Merge command is-
git merge <branch-name>
